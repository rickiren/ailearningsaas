# Skills Visualization in Mindmaps

## Overview

We've enhanced the mindmap visualization to display individual skills as separate blocks below each module and lesson. This creates a more granular view of the learning path, showing exactly what skills will be mastered at each level.

## What's New

### 1. Skills as Individual Nodes
- Each skill within a module or lesson is now displayed as a separate purple block
- Skills are positioned below their parent module/lesson in a third row
- Each skill has its own unique styling and progression indicators

### 2. Enhanced Layout
- **Level 0**: Course title (root node)
- **Level 1**: Modules (blue blocks)
- **Level 2**: Lessons (green blocks) 
- **Level 3**: Skills (purple blocks)

### 3. Visual Improvements
- Skills are connected to their parent modules/lessons with purple dashed lines
- Skills have smaller, more compact styling to fit more content
- Background grid includes a third horizontal line for the skills level
- Legend now includes skills with purple indicators

## How It Works

### Data Structure
Skills are defined in the `skills` array for each module and lesson:

```json
{
  "id": "html",
  "title": "HTML Basics",
  "level": 1,
  "skills": ["Semantic HTML", "Accessibility", "SEO Basics", "Form Handling"],
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "html-structure",
      "title": "Document Structure",
      "level": 2,
      "skills": ["DOCTYPE Declaration", "Head Section", "Body Structure"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Automatic Generation
- Skills are automatically converted to individual nodes when the mindmap is rendered
- Each skill gets a unique ID: `{parentId}-skill-{index}`
- Skills inherit difficulty and other properties from their parent
- Default estimated time of 1 hour is assigned to each skill

### Positioning Logic
- Skills under modules are positioned relative to the module's center
- Skills under lessons are positioned relative to the lesson's center
- Skills are spaced horizontally using `SKILL_SPACING` (200px)
- Skills are positioned at `VERTICAL_SPACING * 3` (600px from top)

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Learning Path**: Users can see exactly what skills they'll master
2. **Better Planning**: Individual skill blocks make it easier to track progress
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between modules, lessons, and skills
4. **Scalability**: Can accommodate many skills without cluttering the view

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `components/artifacts/mind-map-canvas.tsx` - Main layout and skills generation logic
- `components/artifacts/mind-map-node.tsx` - Node styling for skills level
- `components/test-mindmap.tsx` - Updated test data with skills

### Key Functions
- `convertToFlowData()` - Generates skill nodes and positions them
- `getLevelStyling()` - Provides appropriate styling for each level
- `getProgressionText()` - Shows "SKILL X" for skill nodes

## Testing

To test the skills visualization:

1. Use the "Test Mindmap JSON Detection" button in the chat
2. The test mindmap includes skills for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript modules
3. Skills will appear as purple blocks below each module and lesson
4. Each skill is connected with a purple dashed line to its parent

## Future Enhancements

- Skill difficulty indicators
- Skill completion tracking
- Skill-specific resources and exercises
- Skill prerequisites visualization
- Skill grouping and categorization
