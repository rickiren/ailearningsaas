# TODO List

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Focus: Building Progress & Code Streaming**

### âœ… **Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Fix API errors causing internal server error
- [x] Ensure AI calls create_artifact tool properly  
- [x] Test that artifacts render correctly in the preview panel
- [x] Test complete user flow from chat input to artifact rendering
- [x] Fix HTML artifacts breaking page design when rendered
- [x] Create CodeStreamingPreview component for real-time code display
- [x] Update progress tracker to handle building states
- [x] Integrate building progress simulation in zero280 API
- [x] Add code streaming to build page chat interface

### ðŸ”„ **In Progress:**
- [ ] Test end-to-end building flow with progress indicators
- [ ] Verify code streaming works correctly in chat UI
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions between thinking â†’ building â†’ streaming â†’ preview

### ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps:**
- [ ] Test the complete user experience
- [ ] Fine-tune timing and animations
- [ ] Add more building steps and progress details
- [ ] Consider adding syntax highlighting for streaming code

### ðŸŽ¨ **User Experience Flow:**
1. **User types request** â†’ AI starts thinking
2. **Thinking phase** (2s) â†’ Shows "Analyzing your request..."
3. **Building phase** (3s) â†’ Shows tool execution progress with steps:
   - "Generating component structure..." (25%)
   - "Adding styling and layout..." (50%) 
   - "Implementing functionality..." (75%)
   - "Complete" (100%)
4. **Code streaming** â†’ Shows collapsible code preview in chat
5. **Final preview** â†’ Renders artifact in sandbox panel

### ðŸ›  **Technical Implementation:**
- **Progress Tracker**: Enhanced with building step simulation
- **Code Streaming**: Real-time code preview with collapsible interface
- **Building Simulation**: 3-second process with incremental progress updates
- **UI Integration**: Seamless flow from thinking to final preview
