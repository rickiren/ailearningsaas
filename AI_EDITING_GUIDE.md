# AI Editing Guide for Learning Paths

This guide explains how to use AI-powered editing commands to modify your learning paths in real-time through natural language prompts.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Simply type your editing request in the chat input, and the AI will automatically:
1. Parse your natural language command
2. Execute the appropriate editing function
3. Update the mindmap in real-time
4. Provide visual feedback

## üìù Basic Editing Commands

### Module Title Changes
```
change the title of "JavaScript Basics" to "JavaScript Fundamentals"
edit the name of "React Components" to "React Component Architecture"
update the title of "Data Structures" to "Advanced Data Structures"
```

### Module Descriptions
```
change the description of "JavaScript Basics" to "Learn the fundamentals of JavaScript programming"
edit the description of "React Components" to "Build reusable UI components with React"
```

### Module Difficulty
```
set the difficulty of "JavaScript Basics" to beginner
change the level of "Advanced Algorithms" to advanced
set the difficulty of "React Hooks" to intermediate
```

### Module Duration
```
change the hours of "JavaScript Basics" to 4
set the time of "React Components" to 6.5
update the duration of "Data Structures" to 8
```

## üèóÔ∏è Module Management

### Adding New Modules
```
add a new module called "State Management"
create a new lesson called "Error Handling"
insert a new section called "Testing Strategies"
add a new module called "Advanced Patterns" to "JavaScript Basics"
```

### Deleting Modules
```
delete the module "Outdated Content"
remove the lesson "Deprecated Methods"
drop the section "Legacy Code"
```

### Duplicating Modules
```
duplicate the module "JavaScript Basics"
copy the lesson "React Components"
clone the section "Data Structures"
duplicate "JavaScript Basics" to "Advanced JavaScript"
```

### Moving Modules
```
move the module "State Management" to "Advanced JavaScript"
relocate the lesson "Error Handling" to "JavaScript Basics"
```

### Merging Modules
```
merge the module "Basic Concepts" with "Advanced Concepts"
combine the lesson "Introduction" into "Overview"
```

## üéØ Skills and Prerequisites

### Adding Skills
```
add the skill "ES6 Syntax" to "JavaScript Basics"
include the skill "Component Design" to "React Components"
add the skill "Algorithm Analysis" to "Data Structures"
```

### Removing Skills
```
remove the skill "ES5 Syntax" from "JavaScript Basics"
delete the skill "Class Components" from "React Components"
exclude the skill "Basic Math" from "Data Structures"
```

### Adding Prerequisites
```
add the prerequisite "HTML Basics" to "JavaScript Basics"
include the prerequisite "JavaScript Fundamentals" to "React Components"
add the prerequisite "Programming Logic" to "Data Structures"
```

### Removing Prerequisites
```
remove the prerequisite "CSS Basics" from "JavaScript Basics"
delete the prerequisite "DOM Manipulation" from "React Components"
exclude the prerequisite "Basic Math" from "Data Structures"
```

## üéì Course-Level Editing

### Course Title
```
change the course title to "Complete Web Development Bootcamp"
edit the learning path name to "Full-Stack JavaScript Course"
update the course title to "Modern React Development"
```

### Course Description
```
change the course description to "A comprehensive course covering modern web development technologies"
edit the learning path description to "Learn full-stack development from basics to advanced concepts"
```

## üîÑ Advanced Operations

### Reordering Modules
The AI can also handle complex operations like reordering modules based on your requirements.

### Batch Operations
You can combine multiple operations in a single prompt:
```
change the title of "JavaScript Basics" to "JavaScript Fundamentals" and set the difficulty to beginner
add the skill "ES6 Syntax" to "JavaScript Basics" and set the hours to 4
```

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Use exact module titles as they appear in your mindmap
2. **Use Natural Language**: Write commands as you would speak them
3. **One Operation at a Time**: For complex changes, break them into separate commands
4. **Check Module Names**: Ensure you're using the exact module titles from your mindmap

## üé® Visual Feedback

The system provides real-time visual feedback for all AI editing actions:
- ‚úÖ **Green**: Successful operations
- ‚ùå **Red**: Failed operations  
- üîµ **Blue**: Information and loading states
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: Warnings and confirmations

## üîß Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Natural Language Processing**: Your command is parsed using pattern matching
2. **Function Mapping**: The AI maps your request to specific editing functions
3. **Module Resolution**: Module titles are resolved to internal IDs
4. **State Update**: Changes are applied to the mindmap state
5. **Visual Feedback**: Success/failure messages are displayed
6. **Database Sync**: Changes are automatically saved to the database

### Supported Patterns
The AI recognizes various phrasings for the same action:
- `change` / `edit` / `update` / `modify`
- `add` / `include` / `create` / `insert`
- `remove` / `delete` / `drop` / `exclude`
- `set` / `configure` / `adjust`

### Error Handling
- **Module Not Found**: The AI will tell you if a module doesn't exist
- **Invalid Values**: Difficulty must be beginner/intermediate/advanced
- **Permission Issues**: Some operations may be restricted for root modules

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Module not found"**: Check the exact spelling of module titles
2. **"Failed to execute"**: Ensure you have an active mindmap
3. **"Invalid difficulty"**: Use only: beginner, intermediate, or advanced

### Getting Help
- Use the chat interface to ask questions about editing
- Check the visual feedback for specific error messages
- Try rephrasing your command if it's not recognized

## üîÆ Future Features

Planned enhancements include:
- **Voice Commands**: Speak your editing requests
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple changes in one command
- **Undo/Redo**: Revert AI editing actions
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI recommendations for improvements
- **Template Library**: Pre-built module templates

**Happy Editing!** üéâ The AI is here to make your learning path creation as smooth and intuitive as possible.
